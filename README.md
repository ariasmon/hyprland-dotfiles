This is my minimal configuration for the Hyprland environment. It's simple, good-looking, and built for getting work done.
If you are starting with Hyprland, this configuration can help you learn since it's not a complex setup.

Includes:
#Hypridle
#Hyprlock
#Hyprpaper
#Waybar
#Wofi
#electron-flags.conf (Flags to force Electron-based apps to run on Wayland)

You can use Stow to manage the dotfiles!
